    "text": "Education\nCarlo Broderick is a master’s student at UCSB’s Bren School of Environmental Science and Management pursuing a degree in environmental data science. He received his Bachelor’s degree in Environmental Studies and Economics from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a focus in non-governmental market regulation.\nExperience\nCarlo went on to become the first employee of SupplyShift, a software company focused on supply chain management and corporate responsibility that now manages an international team of more than 60. At SupplyShift, he oversaw the implementation of multiple Fortune-500 supply chain data collection and analysis programs. Later, Carlo became the program coordinator for UC Santa Barbara’s Mellichamp Sustainable Materials and Product Design Initiative. From these two career postings, Carlo gained extensive experience within sustainability organizations that use data to address our many environmental crises.\nFuture"
